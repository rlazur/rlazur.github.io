                                    <p>Most intro to neutrino talks start roughly the same way. First the audience is best primed if they start thinking about big numbers, you could ask the audience whether they think there are more grains of sand on Earth or stars in the sky. The answer doesn’t really matter, but there are like 10^18 grains of sand on earth, or a trillion trillion grains. Then, while reaching for a strategically placed bottle of water, you note that several times that many neutrinos will pass through your body over the course of your life….Take a sip. Then you can launch yourself into a lecture about what neutrinos are exactly.</p>

                                    <p>I want to try challenging myself and structure this presentation a bit differently; constraints breed creativity. I want to start this multi-part series on neutrinos with a history lesson, not a physics one. In this series, I will have three episodes about neutrinos: one focussed on history, one on physics, then one on math. I think that STEM would attract a broader range of thinkers if every now and again a lesson would discuss the history, philosophy, or morality of a scientific topic. So, without further ado, here’s the history of the discovery of the neutrino.</p>


                                    <p>To set the scene for the discovery of the neutrino, I think we need to put ourselves back in the turn of the 20th century. If you were a reasonably wealthy 20-something alive in 1900, you’d get to be one of the first to experience cameras, cars, and airplanes; radio is also getting pretty good. You’d get to listen to the first Tour de France and Olympics and travel to the World’s Fair in Chicago. Things are going great for physics, Max Planck is dropping quantum bangers, the first nobel prize of Physics was given for the discovery of X-radiation in 1901 and we finally have the technology to see the atoms that up everything.</p>

                                    <p>Here’s a list of a few of the physicists alive at the moment:</p>
                                    <ul><p>Albert Einstein, Enrico Fermi, Niels Bohr, Ludwig Boltzman, Paul Dirac, Hans Geiger, Edwin Hubble, Robert Oppenheimer, Wolfgang Pauli, Max Planck, Ernest Rutherford, Erwin Schrodinger, Antoine-Henri Becquerel, Subrahmanyan Chandrasekhar, Marie Curie, Werner Karl Heisenberg, Gustav Hertz, … (yeah I know this is kind of misleading, Einstein is going through his angsty train phase at the moment)</p></ul>

                                    <p>With the turn of the century came the birth of subatomic physics. In 1897 the electron was observed for the first time by J. J. Thomson and protons were observed one year later by Dr. Goldstein. Actually, J. J. Thomson says that he was observing the “cathode ray” in his “cathode ray tube,” but cathode rays, electrons, and beta particles are all the same thing. Redundant nomenclature becomes a regular character in this story. </p>


                                    <p>Despite all this technological and theoretical progress being made, neutrinos won’t be proposed for another 35 years! And won’t be observed for another 25 after that (with a nobel prize trailing another 40 years). Yes, there was a world war distracting everyone, but the point I’m trying to make is that neutrinos are stealthy little devils. There is another reason I am starting here: this kicks of the series of events that leads to Pauli coming up with the neutrino in 35 years. Now that Nobel Prizes are being given out to scientists for studying radiation-related phenomena, there are lots of great scientists getting in the game of looking at subatomic particles. </p>

                                    <p>Here’s basically how radioactivity works: an atom spontaneously moves from a higher energy state to a lower one, emitting particles in the process. And if you have a lump of a pure radioactive element in your lab, every time a C-14 atom decays into N-14, a very specific amount of energy will be released. At least that is what all the best theories say.</p>

                                    <p>The experimentalists were noticing a problem. No matter how good of an experiment they designed they were never measuring beta particles at these theoretical energies. In fact, the energies weren’t even that consistent, you could get beta particles at any energy between 0 and the theoretical value. Wolfgang Pauli was determined to solve this problem. </p>

                                    <p>In a letter that starts “Liebe Radioaktiv, Danen und Harren (Dear Radioactive Ladies and Gentlemen),” Pauli lays out his ideas. He says that the best explanation for what the experimentalists are seeing is that there is an invisible particle sharing some of the decay energy. The difference between throwing one cue ball into one pool ball, vs throwing it into two. The big catch is that this new particle must be entirely invisible to every detector and calorimeter they had at the time. I consider it brave to propose such an inconvenient particle; Pauli’s fame gave the idea a lot of teeth. Pauli later notes that he “fears he has discovered a particle that can never be discovered.”</p>

                                    <p>At first Pauli’s particle was called “the neutral one” or “neutron” in Italian. A few years later Chadwick is awarded the Nobel prize for discovering the neutral nucleon we call the neutron today. The neutrino got its current name from the ~35 year old Enrico Fermi who jokingly called it the “little neutral one” at a physics conference in 1934.</p>

                                    <p>Pauli, one of the greatest scientists to ever live, was wrong about this. The first neutrino detection was reported in 1956, more than 20 years after the proposal and just two years before Pauli’s death. Let me explain how they pulled it off.</p>

                                    <p>The first thing we must accept is that we do not, yet, have the technology to detect neutrinos directly in the way we detect photons or electrons. This is because neutrinos interact with the world via the weak force, not the electromagnetic force, and it’s pretty damn weak. Looking for the weak force in the universe is like trying to whisper to somebody at a Megadeath concert. Luckily, we know that neutrinos can produce secondary particles, like protons, electrons, and photons, that we can see! So neutrino physicsts are like detectives; we are looking for traces left by the neutrinos when they interact with the world. </p>

                                    <p>In 1956, the Cowan-Reines Neutrino Experiment saw photons that almost certainly came from neutrinos. What they did was put two massive tanks of cadmium chloride + water into a mine, surrounded by light sensors, close to a radioactive power plant. The idea is that cadmium is a particularly good neutrino absorber and it scintillates (or gives off light) after it absorbs a neutrino. The tanks are close to nuclear reactors for the same reason butterfly watchers hang out near Black-Eyed Susans, and the tanks are huge for the same reason butterfly nets are wide. Although Cowan died in 1974, Reines lived to receive the nobel prize in 1995 for this work. </p>

                                    <p>We’re still building neutrino experiments to this day; in fact, the several billion dollar DUNE experiment is currently under construction. If we’ve known about these particles for 85 years and neutrinos virtually never impact humans, why do we care? Honestly, the main reason is the same as why humans spread from Africa to the Americas, why we like climbing mountains, and why we go to space. This research is on the frontier of physics and we just cannot help ourselves but to carry on. Knowing more about neutrinos will help us answer the questions regarding why we exist. Neutrinos can explain why we are made out of matter and anti-matter seems to be nearly extinct.</p>

                                    <p>A more diplomatic answer is that we can build neutrino telescopes to basically get another finger on the pulse of the universe; there is already a supernovae monitoring network (SNEWS) established between various neutrino experiments around the globe. And because everything about making and testing nuclear weapons produces a neutrino signature, we could use neutrino detectors as a global nuclear materials monitoring system. Also, neutrinos could be used to communicate to deep-sea nuclear submarines that are out of range of radio.</p>


                                    <p>So far I’ve discussed how the neutrino has no charge, rarely interacts with anything, and carries energy from radioactive events. You know that there are more neutrinos in the universe than any other massive particle, but I don’t think I’ve mentioned much else about their mass. Neutrinos were originally hypothesized to have no mass at all, but the Nobel prize in 2015 was given for the discovery that neutrinos have very small masses. There are several consequences to this that I’ll get into in another episode. </p>

                                    <p>The last important thing to know about neutrinos is that there are three types of them; well they’re called ‘flavors’. There are three flavors of neutrino: chocolate, vanilla, and berry. Just kidding, they are called the electron neutrino, muon neutrino, and tao neutrino. We can tell them apart by the particles that the neutrino decays into after it interacts. Electron neutrinos decay into electrons, muon neutrinos decay into muons, and tao neutrinos decay into taons. </p>

                                    <p>Okay, sorry, one bonus fact. The three different neutrinos do this super strange thing where they change flavors as they travel through spacetime. There was a big mystery for a while because it seemed like the sun wasn’t producing enough neutrinos. We know that the sun is just a big ball of light element fusion which means that there are a lot of electrons turning into a lot of electron flavored neutrinos. But no experiment was able to capture enough solar electron neutrinos to match the theory. The solution was that lots of the electron neutrinos were turning into muon and tao neutrinos as they reached Earth. I’ll absolutely explain more about this in another episode. </p>
