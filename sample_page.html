										<h1>A Type For Fun</h1>
									</header>

									<p>When I was 20, I was in a fraternity and it was the night that we inaugurated our pledges into the brotherhood that semester. I was enjoying practicing my beer pong when I realized I had physics homework due in the morning; this wasn’t the first time I’ve done physics homework under the influence of a performance de-hancing drug. I just needed something to eat to take the edge off my buzz, but there was nothing in my room. I made the bad decision to drive to the McDonalds a few miles away to pick up some food.</p>
									<p>I was starting to feel better as I was eating the fries as I drove back home. I was drifting down the big hill about to take the final turn to my neighborhood when I was blinded by red and blue lights. I immediately pulled over and kept my hands on the steering wheel while putting all my mental energy into keeping my heart from not exploding. I can’t remember exactly what I said to the officer or what he said to me, but I remember feeling that there was absolutely zero chance I was not going into his cop car. No matter how many times I fluttered my blue eyes or shed a blonde tear.</p>
									<p>This article is not meant to be a commentary on race, but I undoubtedly have had an easier go at life as a white, blonde, healthy, male. I’ve lived an exceptionally privileged life in a lot of ways. I was born in America to two wonderful middle-class people. I never had glasses, braces, or any other obvious nucleation site for bullies. I was a bit overweight, but not more than most people. I was also gifted with a very un-punchable face and very fast legs. I wasn’t bullied much as a kid and my parents did a great job sheltering me from a lot of things.</p>	 
									<p>For as long as I can remember, adults told me I was “gifted.” I got to skip two hours of elementary school a week to solve logic puzzles with a few other “gifted” kids. I think people got good at finding excuses for dumb things I would do. I had a bad habit of leaving things at home when I would go on school trips; I have left my instrument at home several times on band trips and my cleats when I would travel for Track. I would feel bad when I Dad would make the trip to bring it to me, but I knew I always had a safety net. Once again, the only reason I’m bringing any of this up is to set up my arrest as a pivotal time in my life.</p>
									<p>Although I only spent 6 hours in jail and spent most of that time talking about Super Smash Bros and World of Warcraft with my cellmate, getting arrested was one of the scariest things to happen to me. I had to take a day off school to collect myself before approaching my family and professors; I was terrified to lose my safety net or get kicked out of school. To my pleasant surprise, I had an awesome conversation with my mentor in the physics department and my parents didn’t yell at me.</p>
									<p>After selling my car to avoid getting buried in insurance and court fees, and having my online drug and alcohol counseling class denied by the court; I spent two weeks that summer biking to the courthouse in the next town to complete their counseling course. On days when I biked through the rain, I tried to keep myself from joking that the class was just making me want to drink more. That summer, I also completed a mandatory 60 hours of community service and put myself on a voluntary alcohol fast; it was towards the end of this fast that I got my first tattoo. It is a heavy chain with one broken link, done in a classic Americana style. I designed it in apropos of two of my favorite quotes at the time: “The chains of habit are too light to be felt until they are too strong to be broken” and “If I have seen further, it is by standing on the shoulders of giants.” The tattoo is hanging from my shoulder to my bicep.</p>
									<p>Over the course of the next two years I moved out of the fraternity, got myself hooked on fitness, started meditating, switched to a plant-based diet, and got accepted to grad school. In a way that requires two paragraphs on context, getting a DUI was one of the best things to happen to me. I’m enjoying watching the winds form off the flapping of these butterflies’ wings.</p>

									<p>Two years ago, when I was a grad student in Colorado, my roommates and I geared for a trip to Utah. ‘Roommates’ is an understatement; we called this a “Family Trip” and I had the privilege of being a groomsman at Mom and Dad’s wedding not too long ago. Our plan was to take a 9-day camping trip, hitting three National Parks. I wasn’t involved in much of the planning, which was probably for the best. I was just preparing myself for the longest camping trip of my life, by far.</p>
									<p>If you polled the gang, I’m sure they’d say I was NOT excited to sleep outside; which is absolutely true. A hill I will die on is that I don’t think anybody actually LIKES sleeping outside, anybody who says otherwise is insane by today’s standards. I refuse to believe that most people don’t use the ‘download Netflix and bring a handle of whiskey’ strategy to fall asleep when they go camping.</p>
									<p>Anyway, I’m proud to announce that I survived more than a week of camping outside in a notoriously rocky part of the world with no more than a sleeping pad, a 0-degree sleeping bag, and five days’ worth of downloaded podcasts. Not only that, but it even snowed on us halfway through; in the desert! If I were there by myself, or with people less trained in stoicism than my friends, I would have most likely gone home after it started snowing. </p>
									<p>After 9 days of sleeping, going to the bathroom, and bathing outside; we reached the beds and showers of one of our relatives in Colorado. I still didn’t have a clean pair of clothes, but it’s hard to describe how much more you appreciate plumbing and the discovery of memory foam after being without it for so long. There’s really nothing stopping me from feeling this depth of appreciation without fasting from it, but it’s impossible to bottle the feeling. In the book Flowers for Algernon, the narrator starts as a mentally handicapped person and the first chapter is basically unintelligible scribbles. As the book goes on, the narrator receives medication that makes him increasingly more intelligent over time, until it all wears off at once. You see the narrator struggle to cope with the fact that he knows he used to be normal and he fell in love but is no longer capable of those things. Being in nature trains a type of intelligence.</p>
									<p>On our way home, we met up with one of our friends at a pizza parlor in some old mining town. We were, of course, chatting about our trip, talking about how cold and windy it was; but we all agreed that it was 100% worth it. Adam, our “Dad”, started talking about his ideas on the different types of fun. He explains that there are three types of fun:</p>
									<ul>
										<li>Type 1 fun is what people are referring to nearly 100% of the time in normal conversation. You do a thing then your body rewards that decision with an injection of dopamine. It’s usually pretty clear, the relationship between the action and the good feeling. Casually playing video games, petting a dog, and having a great dinner are all examples of this. </li>
										<li>Type 2 fun is usually what people are referring to when they’re covered in sweat and projecting words out between breaths. There is a much greater distance between the action and the reward for type 2 fun. People who engage in type two fun often do it because they want some sort of reward not directly associated with the action. Hiking a mountain and enjoying the view is an example of this. Most people say they enjoy lifting barbells or hiking mountains, but imagine if you felt the way you feel during those activities randomly during the day. You’d probably take yourself to the hospital.</li>
										<li>Type 3 fun is probably rarely discussed. Type three has the furthest separation between action and reward, and the reward is the most ambiguous. I’d be willing to bet that most Americans will never seek out type 3 fun in their entire lives. Type three fun is running a marathon, practicing survivalism, or committing yourself to higher education. Type three fun is kind of an oxymoron because it is not fun in the way that most people think of fun; at no point do you get a rush of dopamine. The reason you want to engage in type three fun is that it makes the rest of your life slightly less shitty.</li>
									</ul>
									<p>I recently ran my first marathon. I started training after the gyms closed in 2020 because of COVID and trained for about twenty weeks for the 2020 Louisville Marathon. At several points during the race, when the lazy homunculus in my brain was telling me I was in too much pain to keep going, I thought back to the countless number of days I hit the road before the sun did. I thought of the hours I spent writing my food down in a log, the hours of planning my training plan, the days in my running shoes, and how I have survived worse pain before. I ran so hard in that race that literally pissed blood at the end and I was incapable of using stairs for a few days. </p>
									<p>I don’t think I was the best runner there, but I did come in first place in my age group. Next time I will be able to push myself even harder. </p>

									<p>I recently got my Master’s degree in Physics practicing experimental neutrino particle physics. Although all my education was focused on physics, the most important skills I took with me have nothing to do with solving Schrodinger’s equations or whatever. It is not uncommon for Graduate Student Advisors to be harsh on their grad students; often this comes from a place of love, I think. I was one of my advisor’s first graduate students and he had high expectations for me; my advisor is also one of the most brilliant people I’ve ever met. Two things I have always struggled with are writing and public speaking; I would always be blocked up and unable to think clearly; my advisor figured this out pretty fast. He gladly agreed to pay for me to sign up for a scientific presentation course. Regardless of whether or not I learned any technical skills from this course, I finally forced myself to practice public speaking. After this, I motivated my advisor to sign me up for as many public speaking gigs as he could find and I got to travel several times a year to practice giving my presentations in massive auditoriums. I am proud of my newfound ability to speak and write confidently; this is type three fun. 
									</p>
									<p>One final example: I chose to go a week and a half without a toilet, despite living in a three-bedroom house by myself. I didn’t have a toilet because I was replacing the subfloor in the only bathroom in my house. Much to the chagrin of my loved ones, I chose to attempt to do this myself which meant it was going to take 10x as long as it should. I did my best to not eat a lot late at night so that I could casually walk, instead of run, to the nearest coffee shop each morning to adorn their facilities and support a local business. I was able to do this for so long that my Mom and Grandpa threw in the towel and paid a handyman to help me out in finishing the bathroom.
									</p>
									<p>After moving from a college town in Colorado, full of Suburu-driving hippies, to a larger college town in Kentucky, full of SUV-driving nuclear parents; I’ve noticed that tons of people just don’t have the vernacular to discuss type three fun. I think that an essential component of type three fun is that you must remove yourself from anthropogenic stimuli for a prolonged time (other than books). I have VERY DIFFICULT time finding peace, quiet, and nature where I live now. A practice I often do when I’m exploring is a new place is to sit and just listen; I try and see how long I can go without hearing a man-made sound. I don’t have stats on this or anything, but where I live now scores super high on the stimulation scale compared to other places I’ve lived like Fort Collins, CO; Kaiserslautern, Germany; or even West Lafayette, IN.</p>
									<p>I recommend that everybody put themselves in an uncomfortable situation at least once a week then write about that experience in a journal. I don’t think you should go do something illegal or reckless but be honest with yourself about what scares you and engage with that idea. Say you glue yourself to your phone or TV to ignore a pain swimming inside you; take a few minutes to sit and have a conversation with that pain. It’ll help you deal with the inevitable pain you will be forced to face in the future. </p>
									<p>I’m a bit of a perfectionist; I get quite upset at myself when I do a bad job on something. Honestly, I like the perfectionism streak in me, but I don’t like when I dwell on little failures amid a constellation of successes. I believe that, subconsciously, I procrastinate on things because I feel like I’m not ready and am scared to produce a bad result. </p>
									<p>I recently bought a house, the three-bedroom, single-bath I mentioned before. Despite the pleas of my Mom and my lazy homunculus, I insist on doing most of the house projects by myself; like the bathroom. My paint lines might not be straight and I might receive some friendly fire from it, but next time I will be better. Every day, do something you can be proud of in a day, in a month, and in a year. </p>
